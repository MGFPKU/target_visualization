# 📊 Chinese National Climate Targets Visualization (Shiny App)

An interactive **Shiny for Python** web app for visualizing China's national climate policy targets — developed by the **Macro and Green Finance Lab at Peking University (MGF@PKU)**.

This tool is designed as a **template** for research, presentation, and educational purposes. It is not intended for local hosting by the general public — instead, it showcases how one might integrate real-time GitHub-hosted datasets into a Shiny app.

## 🔍 Overview

This app visualizes a curated dataset of China's national climate policy targets across sectors such as **GHG Emissions, Energy/Power, Buildings, Transport, LULUCF, Circular Economy, Pollution, and Finance**. Features include:

- 📅 Bar chart showing climate target announcements by year
- 🏷️ Bar chart showing climate targets by category

Powered by:

- [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) for interactivity
- [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive charts
- [`polars`](https://pola.rs/) for fast data wrangling
- GitHub API for real-time data retrieval

---

## 📦 Features

- Two interactive Plotly bar charts (by announcement year and by target category)
- Integrated GitHub data sync (fetches latest release from `MGFPKU/target_dataset`)
- Bilingual UI (Chinese / English, controlled by `LANGUAGE` env var)

## 🧪 Setup (For Contributors Only)

This app uses GitHub as a remote data backend. If you're customizing or extending the app:

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MGFPKU/target_visualization.git
cd target_visualization
```

### 2. Install dependencies

We use `uv` for fast dependency resolution:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

> ⚠️ We do not publish a GitHub token in this repo.
> If you need access for development or testing, contact the maintainers for a personal access token (PAT) with read-only access to the dataset repository.

You'll need to set the token in a `.env` file like:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
LANGUAGE=EN
```

Below is what each variable does:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with read access to the `MGFPKU/target_dataset` repository. The app uses this token to download `dataset.xlsx` from the latest release. Keep this token private (do not commit it).
- `LANGUAGE`: set the UI language for the app. Use `EN` for English or `CN` for Chinese. The value controls which translations are displayed in the interface.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
python -m shiny run --reload app.py
```

Then open your browser to:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

Or more conveniently, install the `shiny` extension to Positron/VS Code and press the Run button.

## 📁 Project structure

The repository layout and purpose of key files:

```
.env                  # Environment variables (not committed, create locally following setup instructions)
app.py                # Main Shiny app (UI + server, renders Plotly charts)
data.py               # Data fetching and processing logic
i18n.py               # Translation helper; reads LANGUAGE to switch UI
translation.json      # Translation strings used by `i18n.py`
sheets.json           # Sheet names and source sheet config for dataset.xlsx
pyproject.toml        # Project metadata / build config (managed by uv)
.python-version       # Python version pinning for uv
requirements.txt      # Dependency pins (optional with pyproject)
LICENSE               # License
README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
.gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

Notes:
- Edit `app.py` to change high-level UI or chart logic.
- `data.py` handles fetching and parsing `dataset.xlsx` from the latest GitHub release.

## 📁 Data Source

The dataset is hosted in a _private_ GitHub repository (`MGFPKU/target_dataset`) along with our data collection scripts. We apologize for the inconvenience. But the dataset provided through the app is updated in real-time and contains most information available on the original source.
